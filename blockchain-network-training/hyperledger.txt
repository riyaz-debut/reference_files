============================introduction of Blockchain====================================

In general terms, a blockchain is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained within a distributed 
network of peer nodes. These nodes each maintain a copy of the 
ledger by applying transactions that have been validated by a 
consensus protocol, grouped into blocks that include a hash that 
bind each block to the preceding block.

==============================Hyperledger Fabric========================================

Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned 
distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in
enterprise contexts, that delivers some key differentiating 
capabilities over other popular distributed ledger or blockchain 
platforms.

==============================key-difference===============================

One key point of differentiation is that Hyperledger was 
established under the Linux Foundation, which itself has a long 
and very successful history of nurturing open source projects 
under open governance that grow strong sustaining communities and 
thriving ecosystems.

Fabric has a highly modular and configurable architecture, enabling 
innovation, versatility and optimization for a broad range of industry 
use cases including banking, finance, insurance, healthcare, 
human resources, supply chain and even digital music delivery.

permissioned:permissioned, meaning that, unlike with a public 
permissionless network, the participants are known to each other, 
rather than anonymous and therefore fully untrusted.

pluggable consensus protocols: that enable the platform to be more 
effectively customized to fit particular use cases and trust models.

do not require a native cryptocurrency: to incent costly mining or to fuel 
smart contract execution.

==============================Modularity===================================
refers to a system's ability to be broken down into components which can 
be separated and recombined.

====================Permissioned vs Permissionless Blockchains:============

In a permissionless blockchain, virtually anyone can participate, and 
every participant is anonymous.

Permissioned blockchains, on the other hand, operate a blockchain amongst 
a set of known, identified and often vetted participants operating under 
a governance model that yields a certain degree of trust.

===============================Privacy and Confidentiality====================
Hyperledger Fabric, being a permissioned platform, enables confidentiality 
through its channel architecture and private data feature. In channels, 
participants on a Fabric network establish a sub-network where every 
member has visibility to a particular set of transactions. 


=============================BLOCKCHAIN-NETWORK=================================


Blockchain network:
1). A blockchain network is a technical infrastructure that provides ledger and smart contract (chaincode) services to applications.
2). smart contracts are used to generate transactions which are subsequently distributed to every peer node in the network where they 
are immutably recorded on their copy of the ledger. 

Creating the Network:
1). First we need a network N
2). Then we need an organization to intiate the network R4
3). Next we need an orderer and peer to create the network but it will need some configuration file that includes details like no. of 
organization, no. of nodes, channel etc.
4). So we create a network-configuration file (NC4)
5). After that we take orderer(O4).
6). Next we need certificate authority to intiate network (CA4)
7). We add Network Administrators to allow organization R1 users to administer the network
8). Organization R4 updates the network configuration to make organization R1 an administrator too. After this point R1 and R4 have equal 
rights over the network configuration
9). Certificate authority CA1 has been added – it can be used to identify users from the R1 organization. 

10). Defining a Consortium:- 
consortium defines the set of organizations in the network who share a need to transact with one another – in 
this case R1 and R2. It really makes sense to group organizations together if they have a common goal

11). Creating a channel for a consortium:- 
Channels are useful because they provide a mechanism for private communications and private data between the members of a consortium.. 
There can be multiple channels in a network.
(note that a channel can have any number of organizations connected to it)

12). Peers and Ledgers:- (a). Peer nodes are the network components where copies of the blockchain ledger are hosted.
    (b). P1’s purpose in the network is purely to host a copy of the ledger L1 for others to access.
    (c). We can think of L1 as being physically hosted on P1, but logically hosted on the channel C1. 
    (d). P1 and O4 can communicate with each other using channel C1.

13). Applications and Smart Contract chaincode:
a). we can start connecting client applications to consume some of the services provided by workhorse 
of the ledger, the peer
b). client application A1 is associated with organization R1; and although it is outside the Fabric 
blockchain network, it is connected to it via the channel C1
Installing a chaincode package:- an administrator in organization R1 must create a chaincode package and install it onto peer node P1.

===Defining a chaincode=== 
organizations need to approve a chaincode definition (A majority, by default) before the chaincode definition can be committed to the 
channel and used to interact with the channel ledger. 

===Endorsement policy=== 
It describes which organizations must approve transactions before they will be accepted by other organizations onto their copy of the 
ledger. In our sample network, transactions can only be accepted onto ledger L1 if R1 or R2 endorse them.

===Invoking a smart contract=== 
sOnce a smart contract has been installed on a peer node and defined on a channel it can be invoked by a client 
application. Client applications do this by sending transaction proposals to peers owned by the organizations specified by the smart 
contract endorsement policy.


===========================Certificate Authorities:======================================
1). Certificate Authority, CA4, which is used to issue certificates to administrators and network nodes. 
2). CA4 plays a key role in our network because it dispenses X.509 certificates that can be used to identify components as belonging to 
organization R4.

=============================What is an Identity?=======================================
The different actors in a blockchain network include peers, orderers, client applications, administrators and more. Each of these actors 
— active elements inside or outside a network able to consume services — has a digital identity encapsulated in an X.509 digital 
certificate. These identities really matter because they determine the exact permissions over resources and access to information that 
actors have in a blockchain network.

====================================Use of an Identity:======================================
Having a valid credit card is not enough — it must also be accepted by the store! 
PKIs and MSPs work together in the same way — a PKI provides a list of identities, and an MSP says which of these are members of a given 
organization that participates in the network.

A PKI is like a card provider, An MSP, on the other hand, is like the list of card providers accepted by the store

=====================================What are PKIs?==============================================
the elements of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). A PKI is comprised of Certificate Authorities who issue digital certificates to parties 
(e.g., users of a service, service provider), who then use them to authenticate themselves in the messages they exchange in their 
environment.

================================Digital Certificates=================================================
A digital certificate is a document which holds a set of attributes relating to the certificate holder. The most common type of 
certificate is the one compliant with the X.509 standard, which allows the encoding of a party’s identifying details in its structure.

==============================Certificate Authorities:==========================================
every node is able to participate in the blockchain network, via the means of a digital identity issued for it by an authority trusted by 
the system. In the most common case, digital identities (or simply identities) have the form of cryptographically validated digital 
certificates that comply with X.509 standard and are issued by a Certificate Authority (CA).

Certificate Authorities issue identities by generating a public and private key which forms a key-pair that can be used to prove identity. 

==============================Why do I need an MSP?========================================
Because Fabric is a permissioned network, blockchain participants need a way to prove their identity to the rest of the network in order 
to transact on the network. 

==============================What is an MSP?==============================================
The MSP identifies which Root CAs and Intermediate CAs are accepted to define the members of a trust domain by listing the identities of 
their members, or by identifying which CAs are authorized to issue valid identities for their members.

==============================MSP domains==================================================
Locally on an actor’s node (local MSP): Local MSPs are defined for clients and for nodes (peers and orderers).

In channel configuration (channel MSP): channel MSPs define administrative and participatory rights at the channel level

===============================Peers=========================================
Peers are a fundamental element of the network because they host ledgers and smart contracts.
A peer hosts instances of ledgers and instances of chaincodes

==============================Channels======================================
Channels allow a specific set of peers and applications to communicate with each other within a blockchain network. 

==============================Orderers======================================
Orderer is responsible for packaging transactions into Blocks, and distribute them to Anchor Peers across the network

==============================chaincode=====================================
Chaincode is a program, written in Go, Node.js that handles business logic agreed to by members of the network. A chaincode can be invoked to update or query the ledger in a proposal transaction. chaincode is used to initialize a ledger with assets, create, read, update, and delete assets.

==============================Concurrency Control Version Check==============
If the transaction has changed between execution time and commit time, then a Concurrency Control Version Check violation has occurred, and the transaction is marked as invalid on the ledger and values are not updated in the state database.
